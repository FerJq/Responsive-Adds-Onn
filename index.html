            <h1>.The Siberian Husky.</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The
              breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by
              its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and
              distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking
              Alaskan Malamute.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Siberian Husky’s compact body, well-furred coat, erect ears,
              and thick, sickle-shaped tail immediately suggest the breed’s
              northern heritage. The breed’s ancestors were originally bred in
              northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and were kept as companion
              dogs for their families as well as endurance sled dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Siberians caught the eye of the public when they began winning
              sled races in the early 1900s, but they made headlines in 1925
              when a legendary musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian
              Huskies 658 miles in only five and a half days to rush a
              lifesaving serum to Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria
              had broken out.

            Huskies were raised in Siberia-Russia by the Chukchi people, who
            valued it as a sled dog and companion. That's why the race name is
            "Siberian" Siberia entered the flow of Russian history relatively
            late, at the end of the sixteenth century. The official Russian
            incursion into Siberia dates to 1581, when the Cossack hetman Ermak
            Timofeevich led a detachment across the Ural Mountains and soon
            after defeated the forces of the Khanate of Sibir'. The paths of
            Novgorodian merchants and Slavic warriors may have reached Siberia
            even earlier, however, as Russian settlement inexorably crept toward
            the land beyond "the Kamen" (an archaic name for the Urals).

            Lately Huskies were brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled dog races and
            soon became established as a consistent winner. The largest state
            admitted to the Union, Alaska became the 49th state in 1959 and is
            located in the northwest region of North America. Acquired by the
            United States in 1867, the territory was dubbed “Seward’s Folly”
            after the U.S. secretary of state who arranged to purchase the land
            from Russia. Critics of the purchase believed that the land had
            nothing to offer, but the discovery of gold in the 1890s created a
            stampede of prospectors and settlers. Alaska is bound by the
            Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.

            <p>
              Through the ages, people have claimed dogs as one of their
              closest, and best, companions. Of all the domesticated animals,
              dogs serve the widest array of roles: protector, helper,
              lifesaver, and companion. Dogs are incredible friends to people,
              and they’ve been companions through centuries. The relationship
              between dogs and people is deep and old. Dogs and people began
              living together 15,000 years ago when dogs followed people’s
              migration throughout East Asia. The connection was natural because
              both people and dogs are social beings. Neither can thrive when
              alone, and both benefit mentally (and often physically) from
              strong social bonds.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Though domestic dogs share 99% of their DNA with wolves, dogs
              exude warmth to other dogs and humans that contrasts greatly with
              a wolf’s skeptical and defensive reaction to others. Dogs are
              social pack animals who thrive off of attention and affection,
              making them a prime candidate for a person’s best friend.Since
              dogs have been domesticated to a point where they need us to
              survive, and we tend to find that we need them almost as much,
              people and dogs developed a symbiotic relationship. Most dog
              owners will tell you that their dog is a family member. And having
              a faithful dog at home gives us a listening ear, a warm paw to
              hold, and even strong legs to run beside.

        <h2>Where did the phrase “man’s best friend” come from?</h2>

        <div class="text-grid-section-2">
          <div>
            <p>
              In fact, the phrase “man’s best friend” originated in the American
              Supreme Court in 1870 when a talented lawyer named George Graham
              Vest defended a man who deeply loved his coon hound named Old
              Drum. Vest argued that when a neighbor killed Old Drum for
              trespassing, the neighbor took the life of more than just a pet—he
              killed an important family member. Vest famously stated, “The one
              absolute, unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish
              world—the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous—is his
              dog.”

              Dogs have proven themselves time and again to be loyal, kind,
              understanding, and have an indomitable spirit. They greet us
              happily after what may have been the worst day of our lives and
              make us feel better with a wag of their tail and a playful grin.
              Whether they’re herding sheep, hunting game, supporting people
              with disabilities, or simply acting as a companion unlike any
              other, dogs help humans with day-to-day tasks, many of which may
              not be possible without them. Dating back to the 16th century,
              dogs have served as service helpers for the blind, and by the
              1970s dog trainers developed techniques for dogs to assist people
              with disabilities.

              well-documented in many scientific studies. As reported in a
              recent Time Magazine article, the health benefits of living with a
              dog include: Links to a longer life span, lower risk of
              cardiovascular disease, reduce the adverse health effect of living
              alone, can decrease allergies and asthma in children, increase

              The truth is: we call dogs our best friends because, in most of
              the ways that matter, they are. As dogs and humans have developed
              a deep relationship over thousands of years, dogs have become part
              of our families. We take pride in our dogs, and sometimes show
              them off to others as we would our children. We play with them,
              hold them close, and rely on them for services they have evolved
              to provide and enjoy doing.
