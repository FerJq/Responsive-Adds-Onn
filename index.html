            <hr />
            <p>
              The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The
              breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by
              its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and
              distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking
              Alaskan Malamute.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Siberian Husky’s compact body, well-furred coat, erect ears,
              and thick, sickle-shaped tail immediately suggest the breed’s
              northern heritage. The breed’s ancestors were originally bred in
              northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and were kept as companion
              dogs for their families as well as endurance sled dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Siberians caught the eye of the public when they began winning
              sled races in the early 1900s, but they made headlines in 1925
              when a legendary musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian
              Huskies 658 miles in only five and a half days to rush a
              lifesaving serum to Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria
              had broken out.

            Huskies were raised in Siberia-Russia by the Chukchi people, who
            valued it as a sled dog and companion. That's why the race name is
            "Siberian" Siberia entered the flow of Russian history relatively
            late, at the end of the sixteenth century. The official Russian
            incursion into Siberia dates to 1581, when the Cossack hetman Ermak
            Timofeevich led a detachment across the Ural Mountains and soon
            after defeated the forces of the Khanate of Sibir'. The paths of
            Novgorodian merchants and Slavic warriors may have reached Siberia
            even earlier, however, as Russian settlement inexorably crept toward
            the land beyond "the Kamen" (an archaic name for the Urals).

            Lately Huskies were brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled dog races and
            soon became established as a consistent winner. The largest state
            admitted to the Union, Alaska became the 49th state in 1959 and is
            located in the northwest region of North America. Acquired by the
            United States in 1867, the territory was dubbed “Seward’s Folly”
            after the U.S. secretary of state who arranged to purchase the land
            from Russia. Critics of the purchase believed that the land had
            nothing to offer, but the discovery of gold in the 1890s created a
            stampede of prospectors and settlers. Alaska is bound by the
            Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.
